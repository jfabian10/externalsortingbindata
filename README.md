# externalsortingbindata
Project done by Jesus Fabian & John Marshall. 
  The  input  data  file  willconsist of many 4-byte records, with each record consisting of two 2-byte (short) integer values inthe range 1 to 30,000.  The first 2-byte field is the key value (used for sorting) and the second 2-bytefield contains a data value.  The input file is guaranteed to be a multiple of 4096 bytes.  All I/Ooperations will be done on blocks of size 4096 bytes (i.e., 1024 logical records).Warning:  The data file is abinaryfile, not a text file.Your job is to sort the file (in ascending order),  using a modified version of Quicksort.  Themodification comes in the interaction between the Quicksort algorithm and the file storing the data.The array being sorted will be the file itself, rather than an array stored in memory.  All accessesto  the  file  will  be  mediated  by  a  buffer  pool.   The  buffer  pool  will  store  4096-byte  blocks  (1024records).   The  buffer  pool  will  be  organized  using  the  Least  Recently  Used  (LRU)  replacementscheme.
